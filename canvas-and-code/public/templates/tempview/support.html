              <p>
                Trying to conceive, coping with loss, or adjusting to pregnancy and postpartum can bring emotional highs and lows. 
                Therapy offers space to process fertility challenges, miscarriage, or pregnancy termination and to explore the complex mix of grief, joy, and change with compassion and without judgment.

              <h5>Motherhood and Caregiving</h5>
              <p>
                Motherhood transforms everything, your time, your relationships, and your sense of self. 
                Whether you’re adjusting to life with a new baby, navigating the ups and downs of parenting, or caring for aging parents, it’s easy to lose yourself along the way. 
                Together, we’ll help you find your footing and make space for yourself again..

              <h5>Mental and Emotional Wellness</h5>
              <p>
                When stress, burnout, or anxiety start to take over, it’s easy to lose your sense of self. 
                Maybe you’re running on empty, snapping more than you’d like, or just not feeling like you. 
                In therapy, we’ll slow things down, make sense of what’s happening, and help you feel more grounded and at ease.

              <p>
                If you’ve wondered whether you might have ADHD, or if you’ve long felt scattered, distracted, or constantly behind, you’re not alone. 
                We’ll look at your patterns with curiosity and compassion, finding ways to work with your brain, not against it. 
                Together, we’ll create strategies that align with your strengths and bring greater calm and confidence.

              <h5>Relationships and Relational Support</h5>
              <p>
                Relationships can be complicated, even with the people we love most. 
                You might feel disconnected from your partner, family, or friends, or unsure how to express what you need. 
                In therapy, we’ll explore the patterns that create distance or tension and strengthen communication, boundaries, and connection with others and with yourself.

              <h5>Loss and Grief</h5>
              <p>
                Loss comes in many forms, a person, a relationship, a place, or even a version of yourself. 
                Sometimes the pain lingers because we’ve never had space to fully feel it. In therapy, you don’t have to hold it together. 
                We’ll make room for the sadness and help you begin to find meaning and healing.

              <h5>Life Transitions and Identity</h5>
              <p>
                Life has a way of shifting when you least expect it. 
                Marriage, divorce, career changes, or new chapters can leave you questioning who you are and what’s next. 
                Therapy offers a place to explore who you’re becoming and clarify what truly matters to you.

              <h5>Midlife, Aging, and Purpose</h5>
              <p>
                Midlife can bring unexpected questions and change. 
                You might notice shifts in your body or hormones, feel restless in your routines, or wonder what’s next. 
                It’s natural to want something deeper. In therapy, we’ll explore what’s changing, reconnect with your purpose, and help you feel more centered and fulfilled.

                    I offer teletherapy (video or phone) because it fits the reality of everyday life, especially for women and mothers.
                    Whether you're working, parenting, or just trying to find a quiet moment for yourself, 
                    being able to log in or call from wherever you are can make all the difference.
                    Many clients were unsure about teletherapy at first but quickly find it just as supportive as in person sessions and often even easier to open up from home or on a walk. 
                    Sessions don't have to be perfect;
                    life happens in the background, and that's okay. Therapy should fit your life, not the other way around.

                    I'm an out of network provider, but I make the process simple.
                    I'll check your benefits, explain what's covered, and submit claims for you so you don't have to deal with the paperwork.
                    Some clients pay a smaller portion of the fee upfront while insurance covers the rest. 
                    Others pay in full and are reimbursed directly by their insurance company. You can also use a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA), 
                    and I'll provide everything you need for that.
                    I handle all insurance submissions because I know how busy life can be. My goal is to make therapy easy to access and stress free to manage.

                   I'm not the kind of therapist who just nods and waits for you to talk.
                   I'm fully engaged, asking questions, getting curious, and helping you make sense of what's happening beneath the surface.
                  I draw from a mix of approaches, including psychodynamic therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and mindfulness based tools. 
                  Together, we'll decide what works best for your needs and goals.
                  Therapy is a collaborative process tailored to you, not a one size fits all approach.

                    Most sessions last 45 to 50 minutes. I typically meet with clients once a week since 
                    regular sessions help build consistency and allow for meaningful progress.
                    As things improve, some clients move to biweekly sessions, and later to monthly check ins as they prepare to finish therapy. 
                    Frequency is always flexible and based on your needs. 
                    We'll talk about what feels right and adjust as things change so therapy continues to meet you where you are.

                    Yes. I offer a free 15 minute phone consultation for anyone considering therapy. 
                    It's a chance to ask questions, get a feel for my approach, and see if it may be a good fit before scheduling a full session.
                    Some people prefer to book a session first to see how it feels or compare therapists before deciding. 
                    I fully support that. Finding the right match matters, and I want you to feel comfortable and confident wherever you start.

                    Once you reach out, we'll find a time that works for both of us and complete any paperwork before your first session.
                  Our first meeting is a chance to talk about what's been challenging, what you hope to get out of therapy, and anything else on your mind.
                  If you decide to continue, we'll choose a consistent day and time that fits your schedule. 
                  I do my best to stay flexible when life gets hectic because women are often balancing so much.
