        <p>
            Canvas and Code is founded and run by Brenden Camastro. Since Brenden was a child he loved all things 
            technology and computers. As a teenager he spent many hours on building computers for friends, creating 
            websites and fixing anyone’s tech issues. When Brenden got older he successfully started his photography 
            company and has done weddings, events, engagement photos, business photoshoots, branding shoots, product 
            photos, videography for businesses and headshots. While building the photography company Brenden attended 
            courses in computer science, software development, coding and web design. During this time he fell in love 
            with this side of technology and knew this was his career path. His passion for coding business websites 
            came when he started running the backend technology side of his wifes salon and training company. As he 
            maintained a luxury high end look and feel for this business, many more businesses started reaching out 
            for branding photos and or website coding services. Brenden’s skills in coding and photography were combined 
            to create Canvas and Code! At Canvas and Code we are there for you weather it be photos, website development, 
            maintaining websites or a combination of them all we have you covered !
