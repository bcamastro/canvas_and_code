        <p>
            While website builders and AI tools offer quick fixes, 
            they often lack the strategy, customization, and polish 
            that your business truly needs. I create handcrafted websites 
            that not only look professional but are built to perform 
            with your brand, goals, and audience in mind. You’re not just 
            getting a site; you’re getting a custom solution designed to 
            grow with you.
