                <p>Chefs David Carmichael and Michelle Quintana had been working together at Michelin-starred 
                    restaurants in Manhattan for the past six years but were both growing restless. In their 
                    respective careers, they had proven themselves in what is arguably the toughest restaurant 
                    city in the world and were ready for a new challenge. They wanted to build and run something 
                    entirely their own. And it wouldn’t hurt if what they created had a little more breathing room 
                    than the tiny New York City kitchens they had been toiling in for years. Quintana, who lives in Brewster, 
                    and Carmichael, who lives in Bedford Hills, spent their long rides on the Metro-North Railroad to and from 
                    Manhattan talking about the kind of business they’d like to open one day. Carmichael grew up in East Hampton, 
                    New York and had fond memories of the town’s Springs General Store. Quintana, who grew up in the Bay Area, 
                    was ready to leave the corporate restaurant world behind and apply her own vision and talents to a new enterprise. 
                    When COVID-19 brought the restaurant world to a standstill, Quintana and Carmichael had the opportunity to 
                    accelerate their plans. Majorelle, the restaurant where they had been working in midtown Manhattan, closed. 
                    Suddenly the chefs had nothing but time: time to apply for a business loan, time to search for the perfect 
                    location, and time to settle on a name.</p>
